## The Data is not included in this directory. To get it locally:

#### 1. Go to https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats

#### 2. Go to the "data" tab

#### 3. Download the "train.zip" file. 
I originally downloaded the "test.zip" file, and then had a script to 
prepend the "cat." and "dog." to the file name. If for whatever reason the 
data in "train.zip" does not work with the code, try downloading "test.zip"
and prepending cat. and dog. where needed.


## To Run:

Run `python client.py`
